### Creating a GO project:

  * First run `go mod init` command which creates a go. mod file to track your code's dependencies. So far, the file includes only the name of your module and the Go version your code supports.

  * Then write in another file (main.go) the main entry of our GO code.

### Creating Web Server:

  * We can use the `net/http` package for listening to traffic on a specific port.
  * HandleFunc just is a method, that registers a function to a path (route) on a thing called default serve MUX.
  * Default Serve MUX is an http handler which maps a path to a function (basically another HTTP handler).

  * `*http.Request` could be read as a stream by using `ioutil.readAll` method.
