* protobuf is a binary message used in gRPC, that you can think of as json in REST.
* in a proto file we define services, methods for these services, and messages for the services.
* indexes of the proto message elements is important and should not be changed.
* Protobuf is performant because the message is encoded as a binary (bunch of numbers) compared to JSON which is encoded as string.
* we use `protoc` cli cmd and `go/grpc` package to generate `go` code from the proto file. This file is used to create grpc-client and/or grpc-server to send and recieve protobuf messages.
