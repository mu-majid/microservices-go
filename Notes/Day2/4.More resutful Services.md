* Using Encoder (json) has much more performance gain that using `Marshal`.
* Use POST for creating resources, and PUT for updating them.
* Remember request Body is an io.Reader object. And Go does not read it right away, we have to start the reading process.
* GO standard library's json package's Encoder/Decoder are utilizing the idea that request Body is a buffered reader, so it read/writes on the fly as the data is coming, and **not wait** for the data to be buffered in memory first before reading or writing it
